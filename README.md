# AWS_Cloud_Microservice_OpenCV_DlLib_
OpenCV and Dlib ports for AWS Lambda for creating computer vision based microservices

All tools necessary to create a simple computer vision based microservice are converted to linux libraries for working seamlessly with
AWS lambda. The applications can include render based fast asyncronous applications or any computer vision process that requires
very hign processing power. A lambda function in that case is the cheapest solution and the fastest too.

The libraries work with python 2. 

Microservices are awesome and the amount of processing power and ram lambda allows us to channel with millisecond precision of cost calculation,
it is a no brainer that this technology will take over in the near future, if it hasent done already.

For converting other libraries to port to lambda, login to your AWS account or any cloud srvice for that matter, pip install the package to
a custom directory and you are good to go!
